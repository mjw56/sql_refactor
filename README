     Mike Wilcox CS336 Database Optimization 
     --------------------------------------
      
     Note: This code was given to use as a template. THe code that I wrote is under src/edu/rutgers/cs336/EntryPoint.java
  
     Ran out of time to really get this working with medium files up, but it is implemented with all SQL.
     Was going to try and implement multi-threading as well but ran out of time.
     
     This program runs by loading in the date from the raw data with LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE
     I then proceeded to create functions for computing the nearest business date, the domain name, 
     and for all of the future 1, 5, 20, 60, and 125 business dates. 
     
     My program is essentially a series of SQL UPDATE statements that are executed. In the process
     I create new columns in the recommendations table and also create a new table to host the SPX data.
     I ran into some trouble with my date logic. The numbers were ever so off in the medium output and I 
     was unsuccessful is debugging these errors before the submission time. 
     
     However, it will still compute the medium file in around 3:30 minutes. I expect that the large file
     will go over the 30 minute mark. The small file is the only one that matches, which clocks in around ~4s.
    
    I was looking into multithreading as well as many other students seemed to get fast times using that method,
    however I saw that as defeating the purpose of this assignment.
