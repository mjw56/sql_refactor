CS 336 - Principles of Information and Data Management  
Project Phase 2


To run the code, first change one of the environment files 
(for example phase2_small.env) to use your netid as RECS_DB_NAME 
and RECS_DB_USER, and your password that can be found in the Dropbox on SAKAI.
Then, use the run_report.sh script as
 ./run_report.sh phase2_small.env

The script will:
  1. clear your database schema of routines, tables and views
  2. compile the code using ant
  3. run the code
  4. report the runtime
  5. check if the generated report matches a report previously generated

The generated report will appear in "out".  Data files are in "raw_data".
"lib" contains MySQL Connector/J (you are not allowed to use any other libraries).
"verify" contains instances of the correct reports.

Your job is the change the code in the src folder to make this code run faster,
but still producing the same output.  You want to make 
"./run_report.sh phase2_full.env" run quickly (30 mins or less).

There should not be any reason to change any files other than the 
environment files for your netid/password, and the code in src. 

Your code must run using the run_report.sh script

Your submission to SAKAI should consist of a brief writeup explaining
how your code works and a gzipped tar of the src folder (with your changes).

Please see the pahse 2 project document in SAKAI for a longer description
